            <h1>Computer programming</h1>
            <p>COMPUTER PROGRAMMING is a step by step process of designing and developing various sets of computer
                programs to accomplish a specific computing outcome. The process comprises several tasks like analysis,
                coding, algorithm generation, checking accuracy and resource consumption of algorithms, etc. The purpose
                of computer programming is to find a sequence of instructions that solve a specific problem on a
                computer.</p>

            <p>English is the most popular and well-known Human Language. The English language has its own set of
                grammar rules, which has to be followed to write in the English language correctly.

                Likewise, any other Human Languages (German, Spanish, Russian, etc.) are made of several elements like
                nouns, adjective, adverbs, propositions, and conjunctions, etc. So, just like English, Spanish or other
                human languages, programming languages are also made of different elements.</p>
